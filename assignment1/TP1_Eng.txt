QUESTIONS:

Q1: Considering the data provided, explain the need to standardize the attribute values.
R1:


Q2: Explain how you calculated the parameters for standardization and how you used them in the test set.
R2:


Q3: Explain how you calculated the prior probability of an example belonging to a class (the probability before taking into account the attribute values ​​of the example) in your Naïve Bayes classifier implementation. You may include a relevant piece of your code if this helps you explain.
