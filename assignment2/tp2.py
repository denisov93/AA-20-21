'''
Goal: 
The goal of this assignment is to examine a set of bacterial cell images 
using machine learning techniques, including feature extraction, 
features selection and clustering, in order to help the biologists organize similar images.
'''
'''
Resources: 
A set of 563 PNG images (in the images/ folder) 
taken from a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy photograph of Staphylococcus aureus.
All images have the same dimensions, 50 by 50 pixels, 
with a black background and the segmented region centered in the image. 
'''
'''
In this assignment, you will load all images, extract features, 
examine them and select a subset for clustering with the goal of 
reaching some conclusion about the best way of grouping these images.
'''

#imports
import tp2_aux as aux 
import numpy as np
#

imgMatrix = aux.images_as_matrix(563)

input_data = "labels.txt"
cellCycleLabels = np.loadtxt(input_data, delimiter=",")

'''
From this matrix, you will extract features using three different methods:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    >Use the PCA class from the sklearn.decomposition module.
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    >Use the TSNE class from the sklearn.manifold module. When creating an object of this class, use the method='exact' argument, for otherwise the TSNE constructor will use a faster, approximate, computation which allows for at most 3 components.
Isometric mapping with Isomap
    >Use the Isomap class from the sklearn.manifold module.
    
With each method, extract six features from the data set, for a total of 18 features.
