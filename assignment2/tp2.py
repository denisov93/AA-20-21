Goal: 
The goal of this assignment is to examine a set of bacterial cell images 
using machine learning techniques, including feature extraction, 
features selection and clustering, in order to help the biologists organize similar images.
'''
'''
Resources: 
A set of 563 PNG images (in the images/ folder) 
taken from a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy photograph of Staphylococcus aureus.
All images have the same dimensions, 50 by 50 pixels, 
with a black background and the segmented region centered in the image. 
'''
'''
In this assignment, you will load all images, extract features, 
examine them and select a subset for clustering with the goal of 
reaching some conclusion about the best way of grouping these images.
